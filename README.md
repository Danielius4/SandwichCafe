# SandwichCafe
Simulation based on stack and queue data structures.

Process: Caf√© has only 2 holders to place sandwiches. The client can take only the very top sandwich from the random holder. New sandwiches are placed on the top of a holder where are fewer sandwiches. In the evening the out-of-date sandwiches are thrown away.

Task: to estimate how the cafe's losses would be reduced if, instead of the existing holders, it purchased 1 or 2 new holders, from which the customer must take the oldest sandwich.
